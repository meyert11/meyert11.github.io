Travis Meyer, is a Senior Data Scientist in Customer Experience at Vanguard. He uses his background as a Neuroscientist at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/neuroscience/), and Deep Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) to develop artifical intelligence tools that process and simplify large amounts of data. 

### Early Academic Research

Travis' early work focused on learning how neural networks in the visual system worked by studying learning, memory and complex visual functions:

- [Working Memory in Prefrontal Cortex Neural Circuits](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245628571_Effects_of_training_to_perform_a_working_memory_Task_on_regular_spiking_and_fast_spiking_neurons_in_the_lateral_prefrontal_cortex) and [Learning in Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51081929_Stimulus_Selectivity_in_Dorsal_and_Ventral_Prefrontal_Cortex_after_Training_in_Working_Memory_Tasks) as part of his PhD Thesis.
- To acomplish this he developed [a new software IDE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8078008_A_software_solution_for_the_control_of_visual_behavioral_experimentation) to control and coordinate the experimental hardware and store the data securely.
- He surprisingly found that the brain automatically cached information unconsciously [publication]https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6114369_Persistent_Discharges_in_the_Prefrontal_Cortex_of_Monkeys_Naive_to_Working_Memory_Tasks)
- He continued exploring this automatic learning and found that the visual system automatically learns the statistical information of objection unconsciously [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51798944_Statistical_Learning_of_Visual_Transitions_in_Monkey_Inferotemporal_Cortex).
- At the neural circuit level, this learning of sharpened the dynamic responses, and is how the brain is able to process familiar things faster [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264987395_Image_Familiarization_Sharpens_Response_Dynamics_of_Neurons_in_Inferotemporal_Cortex).
- The statistical learning led to the brain to make predictions automatically that seemed to follow Bayesian statistics [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316319514_Prediction_Suppression_and_Surprise_Enhancement_in_Monkey_Inferotemporal_Cortex).

### Developing AI/ML

Travis interviewed at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/?hl=EN) and the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/neuroscience/) to see take this knowledge of neural circuitry to develop artificial intelligence algorithms. He chose to move to Philadelphia as the [Director of Visual Memory Laboratories](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/travis-meyer-0) and Lead Senior Researcher to train new graduate students in AI, analytics and experimentation.

- He started by taking on the hardest, stalled, projects and bringing them up-to-date and completed [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345695203_Single-exposure_visual_memory_judgments_are_reflected_in_IT_cortex)
- He then developed a new research pipeline to bring in funding and provide research projects for graduate students.
- To translate research into action, he directed students from Penn's General Robotics, Automation Sensing, & Perception Lab to update reinforcement learning algorithms like the Bellman Equation [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330276192_Visual_novelty_curiosity_and_intrinsic_reward_in_machine_learning_and_the_brain), many of which now work at in industry, like Google Deep Mind and Medtronics.

### 

Developing breakthroughs typical require smaller breakthroughs, necessity truly is the mother of invention. To coordinate complex laboratory hardware with modern computer systems, Travis developed a software solution, ran experiments to examine it's capabilities, [published the results](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8078008_A_software_solution_for_the_control_of_visual_behavioral_experimentation) and then provided it free as [open source software](https://github.com/meyert11/wave)
