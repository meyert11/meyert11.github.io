Welcome to my blog! As someone who has spent years immersed in the world of neuroscience research—first at Carnegie Mellon and later at the University of Pennsylvania—I recently embarked on an exciting new chapter in my career: transitioning to a Senior Data Scientist role at Vanguard. This blog is my space to share insights, lessons learned, and reflections on this journey, as well as to explore topics that inspire me in both science and data.

## Why the Shift?

At first glance, neuroscience and data science might seem worlds apart. However, they share a common thread: the pursuit of understanding complex systems. In neuroscience, I studied how neural networks process information; in data science, I analyze patterns in data to solve real-world problems. The tools and techniques I once used to decode the brain—statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization—are now helping me tackle challenges in finance.

## Lessons from Neuroscience That Shape My Data Science Work

1. **The Power of Asking the Right Questions**  
   In research, formulating a clear hypothesis is half the battle. Similarly, in data science, defining the problem is critical. My academic training taught me to approach problems methodically, ensuring that every analysis starts with a strong foundation.

2. **Interdisciplinary Thinking**  
   Neuroscience thrives at the intersection of biology, psychology, and computation. This interdisciplinary mindset has been invaluable in data science, where collaboration across domains often leads to innovative solutions.

3. **Storytelling with Data**  
   Whether presenting research findings or crafting financial insights, storytelling is key. Communicating complex ideas clearly and effectively is a skill I honed during my academic career and continue to refine in my current role.

## What’s Next for This Blog?

Through this blog, I hope to explore topics that sit at the crossroads of science and data. Here are a few ideas for future posts:
- Practical tips for transitioning from academia to industry.
- How neuroscience principles can inform data science practices (and vice versa).
- Tutorials on machine learning techniques or tools I’ve found useful.
- Reflections on personal growth and career development.

I also plan to write about ongoing projects—both professional and personal—and share resources that have been instrumental in my journey. If you’re interested in neuroscience, data science, or career transitions (or all three!), I’d love for you to join me on this adventure.

## Let’s Connect
