## Projects
### TravNet: automated spike sorted
[Github](https://github.com/meyert11/travnet)

Developed TravNet, a deep learning network, trained on big data platforms of human-sorted neural data to automate a time-limiting task, reducing the daily workload by 25% and fascilitate onboarding.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
